        <h2>🌊 Ancient Myths & Navigation (Before 1000 BCE)</h2>
        <p>Before scientific exploration, oceans were wrapped in myth. People believed sea monsters lived in the deep, and that the horizon was the edge of the world. Yet, even then, early civilizations like the Polynesians and Phoenicians navigated vast waters using stars and wind patterns.</p>

        <h2>⛵ The Age of Exploration (1400s–1600s)</h2>
        <p>Driven by trade and curiosity, European explorers crossed oceans. Though they mapped coastlines, the deep sea remained mysterious. They dropped lead lines to measure depth but rarely touched the seafloor.</p>

        <h2>🧪 The Birth of Ocean Science (1800s)</h2>
        <p>In 1872, the HMS <em>Challenger</em> set sail on the first true oceanographic expedition. Over 4 years, it collected samples, mapped currents, and proved life existed in the deep sea, changing science forever.</p>

        <h2>📡 Seeing the Seafloor (1900s–1960s)</h2>
        <p>World Wars accelerated sonar development, revealing underwater mountains and trenches. Submarines and deep-sea cameras gave us the first blurry glimpses of what lay below.</p>

        <h2>🛰️ Satellites & Global Monitoring (1970s–1990s)</h2>
        <p>With satellites, scientists could finally study the ocean from space. They mapped temperature, color, and currents on a global scale — a leap forward for climate science and conservation.</p>

        <p>Today, underwater drones and autonomous vehicles roam the deep. Sensors on buoys, ships, and even marine animals collect real-time data on temperature, salinity, and ecosystems — constantly feeding scientists new insights.</p>

        <h2>❓ What We Still Don’t Know</h2>
        <p>Despite all we’ve learned, more than 80% of the ocean remains unmapped and unexplored. We don’t fully understand deep-sea ecosystems, ocean floor geology, or how the oceans truly affect climate. The next age of discovery is still ahead.</p>
