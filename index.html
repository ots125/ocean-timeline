      <h2>Ancient Ocean Myths & Navigation (Before 1000 BCE)</h2>
      <p>Long before we understood the science of the oceans, ancient cultures saw the seas as mysterious and often dangerous. The Greeks, for instance, told tales of Poseidon, their god of the sea, who could control the waves with a single strike of his trident. The Norse had their own stories, featuring sea monsters and serpents. But it wasn’t all just myths. The Polynesians, for example, were masters of the sea. They used the stars, ocean currents, and the behavior of waves to navigate vast distances. Their knowledge, passed down through generations, allowed them to explore and settle on islands scattered across the Pacific—sometimes over 2,000 miles away from their starting points. These ancient sailors were not only storytellers but also incredibly skilled navigators, laying the foundation for future ocean exploration.</p>

      <h2>The Age of Exploration (1400s–1600s)</h2>
      <p>The 15th and 16th centuries were a time of discovery and adventure, with explorers like Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama charting new paths across the globe. With the help of new navigation tools, like the compass and the astrolabe, these explorers crossed vast oceans, opening up trade routes that connected Europe, Africa, and the Americas. These voyages also led to cultural exchanges—goods, ideas, and knowledge spread across continents. But the Age of Exploration also came with consequences: the colonization of new lands had lasting effects on indigenous populations. Despite the challenges and controversies, the Age of Exploration reshaped our understanding of the world and set the stage for modern ocean exploration.</p>

      <h2>The Birth of Ocean Science (1800s)</h2>
      <p>The 1800s marked a significant shift in our approach to the oceans. No longer was it just about crossing them; we started to look beneath the surface. The HMS Challenger expedition (1872–1876) is often regarded as the first true scientific ocean voyage. Scientists aboard the ship made groundbreaking discoveries about ocean temperatures, currents, marine life, and even the seafloor. They found incredible diversity in the deep sea—creatures and ecosystems that no one had ever imagined. This era marked the beginning of oceanography as a scientific field, driven by curiosity. It was the first step in understanding the oceans not just as a place to travel, but as a complex, living system full of mysteries waiting to be revealed.</p>

      <h2>Seeing the Seafloor (1900s–1960s)</h2>
      <p>In the early 20th century, technology began to change the way we explored the deep ocean. During World War I, sonar was developed, allowing scientists to map the ocean floor for the first time. This breakthrough led to the discovery of mid-ocean ridges, deep-sea trenches, and undersea mountains. The Trieste bathyscaphe’s 1960 descent into the Mariana Trench—still the deepest known point on Earth—was another major milestone. For the first time, humans reached the most extreme depths of the ocean, witnessing firsthand the alien landscapes and strange creatures that lived there. These technological advances shifted our understanding of the ocean from something vast and uncharted to a place that could be mapped, studied, and understood in greater detail.</p>

      <h2>Satellites & Global Monitoring (1970s–1990s)</h2>
      <p>The 1970s and 1980s introduced a new way of looking at the ocean: from space. Satellites allowed scientists to observe the oceans from above, gathering information on sea surface temperatures, currents, and sea level changes. Satellites like TOPEX/Poseidon made it possible to track large-scale climate patterns like El Niño and La Niña, which have profound global impacts. Beyond climate, satellites also played a crucial role in monitoring marine pollution, coral reef health, and changes to the Earth's oceans over time. This shift in perspective allowed us to view the oceans as interconnected with the global climate system, and it provided invaluable data for marine conservation efforts.</p>

      <h2>Robots & Modern Exploration (2000s–Now)</h2>
      <p>Fast forward to the 21st century, and technology has brought us closer to the ocean's depths than ever before. Robots, including Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), have opened up new frontiers for ocean exploration. These robots can travel to places humans can't go—like the deepest parts of the ocean—and bring back vital data and stunning visuals of life at extreme depths. Missions led by organizations like NOAA’s Okeanos Explorer have discovered new species and ecosystems that were previously unknown to science. These underwater robots allow scientists to explore the ocean in real time, collaborate with teams from around the world, and continue to expand our knowledge of this vast and mysterious environment.</p>

      <h2>What We Still Don’t Know</h2>
      <p>Despite all the progress we’ve made in ocean exploration, the truth is that much of the ocean is still a mystery. More than 80% of the seafloor remains unmapped, and scientists believe that millions of species may still be waiting to be discovered. We don’t fully understand how the deep ocean affects global climate patterns or how life can exist in the extreme environments found at the bottom of the sea. The deepest parts of the ocean—places like hydrothermal vents—are still largely unexplored. And as technology advances, we’re likely to uncover even more secrets hidden beneath the waves. But for now, the ocean remains one of Earth’s greatest mysteries, and there’s still so much left to learn.</p>
